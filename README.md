## Using ArcGIS Notebooks and ArcPy Charts to Explore Data"
ArcGIS Pro Charts</a> provide a powerful way to visualize and explore your data, helping to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and structure that might not be apparent when looking at a table or map. The Charts development team has been working to add chart capabilities to support automation and spatial data science workflows using Python. It’s possible to do all your data preparation, visualization, and analysis completely inside ArcGIS—but you can also mix-and-match the ArcGIS Python libraries with your other favorite libraries.
